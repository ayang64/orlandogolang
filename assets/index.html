			We're a group of Go enthusiasts who meet at least monthly and discuss all
			things Go.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our in-person meetings are held on the <b>third Monday</b> of every
			month.  Our next meeting will be on <b>Monday, August 21</b>. We've been
			having them at Familab in Longwood but we're looking for a more permanent
			home nearer to down town.
